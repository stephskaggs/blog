            <h1>Week 3: Floats float my boat.</h1>
                <h3>September 21, 2014</h3>
                <p>We learned a lot of things this week, more JavaScripts functions and Git GUI  start with. But then we got to floats. And for the first time since I started this class I feel like I completely get something. This is the first time I didn’t struggle with assignments and I actually really enjoyed working on it. </p>

                <p>And then there are functions. I always feel like I’m starting to get this stuff, when in reality it really hasn’t completely clicked for me. It’s just a lot of work to get to a very small output most of the time and I’m not sure I’ll ever be that patients. Another thing I’ll never be is a good typer (typist?). Yes, I’m a writer. But I make more typos than anyone I know and that kind of habit really bite you in the ass when it comes to writing code. There’s always something small and annoying (like a misspelled word) that gives me syntax error after syntax error. </p>

                <p>Like I said, we also learned GIT GUI. I actually really liked it, I think it’s super easy to use. But a lot of my classmates said they found it confusing and would rather use terminal. Which made me then overthink it and wonder if I was doing it right because I had no problems. So now GIT GUI is all in my head for no reason. </p>
