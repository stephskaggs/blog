                    <p>9/21/14: So far so (kinda sort) good, (I guess). We’ve definitely covered a lot. But I think I have a hard time grasping things until I actually see them come to life through building something. So I just keep applying random styles and HTML that I find to my blog to see what it will do. I really want it to look better than it did last week when I created it. And it definitely looks…different. Not sure I can necessarily describe it as “better” so far.<a href="post3.html"> Read more</a></p>

        		  <a href="post2.html"> Week 1: "Install day" sounded so simple</a>
                    <p>9/14/14: Week one at Makersquare is over, kids. If I were still in college I would equate day one to "syllabus day." Our instructors introduced themselves and they all seem super/awesome/cool/the best ever. (They also happen to be the ones who look at my homework.

            	   <a href="post1.html">Prework: Git the eff out</a>
            		<p>9/7/14: I did it. I signed up for the Makersquare front end dev course. So what does that mean? It means, holy moly I have a lot of prework to do. I raced through the HTML and CSS Code Academy work without a sweat. So naturally I assumed the rest would be just as simple... <a href="post1.html"> Read more</a></p>
