            <h1>Week 4: The airing of the grievances.</h1>
                <h3>October 5, 2014</h3>
                <p>They showed us a bell chart on the first day of class that plummets to an all time low on week four. Well, that were we are, folks. We’ve learned a lot of things but none of them are really coming together yet and it’s sometimes hard to see the bigger picture. We had a bit of the airing of the grievances in class which led to “get your butt to office hours” discussion. Right. Will do.  </p>

                <p>Still loving floats. I just built a grid and this stuff is pretty easy for me. </p>

                <p>Still hating JS. Still confusing. Still don’t get it. I think the hardest part is that there’s not really a right and wrong answer. It’s all a way of thinking about things.  And really, I just want a right or wrong answer. Mae walked us through a bunch of exercises in office hours yesterday and it always makes sense watching others think through things, but then I try to do it on my own and can't wrap my head around where to start. Sigh. Hopefully it'll start clicking soon.</p>
