            <h1> Week 2: More learning. Greater confusion. </h2>
                <h2>September 21, 2014</h2>
                    <p>So far so (kinda sort) good, (I guess). We’ve definitely covered a lot. But I think I have a hard time grasping things until I actually see them come to life through building something. So I just keep applying random styles and HTML that I find to my blog to see what it will do. I really want it to look better than it did last week when I created it. And it definitely looks…different. Not sure I can necessarily describe it as “better” so far.<p>
                    <p> We dove head first (at 100 miles per hour) into JQuery in class. It’s one of those things that I can sit and think “I totally get this” until I try to do it outside of class on my own and them I’m definitely like “Nope, nope, nope. Definitely don’t understand.” I spent about 4 hours at a coffee shop with Juliana and Jonathan trying to get through all of our homework exercises. After a while I started to feel like I was totally getting it, and then we reached the last exercise and I had no idea what I was doing all over again. Funny how learning something totally new can do that do you. </P>
                    <p>Here’s the update on the blog look this week! It’s better than nothing. (I guess?)</p>

                    <p> Nice right? What I'm hoping to learn next week? Styling. I'm still totally into learning how to make things look good. (My fear is design school is my only hope.)</p>
