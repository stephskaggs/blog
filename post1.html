            <h1>Prework: Git the eff out</h1>
                <h3>September 7, 2014</h3>
                <p>I did it. I signed up for the Makersquare front end dev course. So what does that mean? It means, holy moly I have a lot of prework to do. I raced through the HTML and CSS Code Academy work without a sweat. So naturally I assumed the rest would be just as simple... </p>

                <p>But alas...then I reached the exercise about command line and Git. GIT? What? I've never even heard that word before. And honestly, I've never accessed my computer's terminal...I'm not sure I knew that was even an option. At the time, I decided that command line and Git were, in fact, the worst.</p>

                <p>That is, until I reached Java. I've had a few people tell me that once Java clicks you think it's the greatest thing ever. I can say with complete assurance that it has definitely not clicked for me. Because it made my life completely miserable. If not for the Q/A forum on Code Academy I'm pretty sure my browser would still be stuck in an infinite loop. It's hard. And it made me feel like shit just got real.</p>

                <p>Bring on the actually classes...I guess.</p>
